Newly christened ‚ÄúCrumpet‚Äù, our clever anti-hero shares his observations of the mayhem in front of and behind the scenes during one chaotic December, from aggressive parents and drunken Santas, to flirtatious actors, poor hygiene, and the racially charged hazards of being a ‚ÄúPointer Elf.‚Äù Will Crumpet find a moment of pure Christmas spirit? Will he end up in Santa‚Äôs cottage with Snowball the elf? Will he escape with his life on Christmas Eve before being torn apart by enraged customers? Based on his beloved humorous and autobiographical essays, David Sedaris‚Äô The Santaland Diaries, adapted for the stage by Joe Mantello, is a wry and witty look at the combination of retail hell and theatrical spectacle that is the holiday season, a sharp, narrowly observed dark comedy. The perfect Christmas treat for grownups, this one-man show has been an annual tradition at theaters across the United States for the past twenty years.</p>
